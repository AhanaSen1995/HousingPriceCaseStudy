# Project Name
Housing Price Case Study
> Outline a brief description of your project.
A company wants to enter a housing market where they want to purchase at a lower price and sell at a higher price.
The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Hence a regularised regression model is built in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
A company wants to enter a housing market where they want to purchase at a lower price and sell at a higher price.
The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and
- How well those variables describe the price of a house.

Hence a regularised regression model is built in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

- The Train.csv dataset is used to build the model
